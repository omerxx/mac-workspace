# Mac Workspace

### A curated list of OSX tools and workspace setups which I find useful and use on my own machine

![Workspace](img/workspace.png)

1. [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is your best friend on mac, start by installing it
	* Use homebrew for every thing: `brew search git`
	* Use cask for UI based apps: `brew cask install slack`

 1. [Docker for mac](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac)
 	* Gives you a local docker hypervisor and machine to use docker with ease

1. [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) - A better OSX terminal

1. [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) - A Terminal multiplexer
	* Map your `caps lock` to `control` and change the hot key to *a* so that `caps lock + a` gives you quick shift around
	* [My `.tmux.conf`](https://github.com/omerxx/dotfiles/blob/master/tmux/.tmux.conf)

1. [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) - A better shell
	* [My `.zshrc`](https://github.com/omerxx/dotfiles/blob/master/zsh/.zshrc) with git mappings
	* [My zsh custom theme](https://github.com/omerxx/dotfiles/blob/master/zsh/omer.zsh-theme)

1. [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/) - Move and resize windows with ease

1. [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) - Spotlight in steroids (extreme search, hot-keys, workflows, keywords etc)

1. [1Password](https://1password.com/) - An amazin password manager 
	* Probably the most important piece of software I bought
	* Costs a little, but ensures privacy, and keeps passwords / keys / tokens even credit cards
	* Handles MFA with ease
	* Installable with brew
